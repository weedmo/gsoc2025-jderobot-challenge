This section contains code and documentation for the ROS2 Challenges.  
The challenges are organized into two main parts:

---

## 📘 Part 1: Introduction to ROS2

### 🟦 a. Hello! ROS2 is fun.  
📁 Path: `ROS2/py_pubsub`

- ✅ Created a new ROS2 workspace  
- ✅ Built ROS2 publisher and subscriber nodes to send the message:  
  > `"Hello! ROS2 is fun."`  
- ✅ Built the package using `colcon`  
- ✅ Ran the executable using `ros2 run`

📷 *Screenshot will be added*

> This example introduces the basic ROS2 package structure and node communication using `rclpy`.

---

### 🟦 b. Launch your robot  
📁 Path: `ROS2/py_pubsub` (or a separate folder)

- ✅ Installed a ROS2-supported robot package (e.g., TurtleBot3)  
- ✅ Visualized the robot’s LaserScan data using `rviz2`

📷 *Screenshot will be added*

> This exercise demonstrates how to use `rviz2` for visualizing sensor data like LaserScan — a critical part of robot perception.

---

## 📘 Part 2: ROS2 Navigation2

### 🟦 a. Navigate your turtlebot  
📁 Path: `ROS2/nav2_waypoints_runner`

- ✅ Installed ROS2 Navigation2 and Gazebo  
- ✅ Launched a robot (e.g., TurtleBot) and performed waypoint navigation  
- ✅ Used at least **three waypoints**  
- ✅ Demonstrated the navigation in a result video

📹 *Video will be added*

> This task demonstrates basic usage of the Navigation2 stack for autonomous navigation. You are free to expand on this, such as modifying behavior trees or using custom goals.
