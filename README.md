📁 ROS2
🔹 Part 1: Introduction to ROS2
a. Hello! ROS2 is fun.
📁 Path: ROS2/py_pubsub

Created a new ROS2 workspace

Developed ROS2 publisher and subscriber nodes to send the message "Hello! ROS2 is fun."

Built the package using colcon

Ran the nodes using ros2 run

📷 Screenshot to be added

This example focuses on understanding the basic structure of a ROS2 package and node communication using rclpy.

b. Launch your robot
📁 Path: ROS2/py_pubsub or a separate folder

Installed a robot package (e.g., TurtleBot3 or any other ROS2-supported robot)

Visualized the robot’s laser scan data using rviz2

📷 Screenshot to be added

This part demonstrates how to visualize sensor data (like LaserScan) in rviz2, which is essential for debugging and understanding robot perception.

🔹 Part 2: ROS2 Navigation2
a. Navigate your turtlebot
📁 Path: ROS2/nav2_waypoints_runner

Installed ROS2 Navigation2 stack and Gazebo

Performed waypoint navigation using a robot (TurtleBot or any other supported robot)

Included at least 3 waypoints for navigation

Recorded a video showcasing the robot moving through the waypoints

📹 Video to be added

This task shows how to use the Navigation2 stack for autonomous navigation. For extended learning, customizing Behavior Trees or sending dynamic goals can be explored.
